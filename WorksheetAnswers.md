## Answers to the worksheet

1. O(logn)

2. O(nlogn)

3. O(logn)

4. The nodes in the left subtree are printed before the nodes in the right subtree.

5. O(n) (with a sorted array)

6. The node holding 10

7. (35 – 15 – 17 – 20), (35 - 10 - 27 - 20)

8. O(n) (height does not include root)

9. Insert(30)

10. False. (sort of acts like DFS)

11. Forward edge

12. No (longest route - 4, least no. of sem - 5)

13. ABDCEGHF

14. 2^h

15. Binary search tree. 
    (priority queue -> search is O(n), 
    Linked List -> insert is O(n), 
    Binary search tree -> insert can be O(n)
    Hashing -> finding min can be O(n))
    
15. Insert, Extract Max, Delete

16. O(1)

17. O(n). (Finding degree of adjacent lists can be done in constant time)
